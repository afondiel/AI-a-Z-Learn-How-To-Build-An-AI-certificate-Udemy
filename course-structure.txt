Course Structure
Hi guys,

welcome again to the course.

It's important to take a first step back now to clearly visualize the structure of this course, which is the following:

Part 0 - Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning
- Q-Learning Intuition
- Q-Learning Visualization

Part 1 - Deep Q-Learning
- Deep Q-Learning Intuition
- Deep Q-Learning Implementation
- Deep Q-Learning Visualization

Part 2 - Deep Convolutional Q-Learning
- Deep Convolutional Q-Learning Intuition
- Deep Convolutional Q-Learning Implementation
- Deep Convolutional Q-Learning Visualization

Part 3 - A3C
- A3C Intuition
- A3C Implementation
- A3C Visualization

Annex 1: Artificial Neural Networks

Annex 2: Convolutional Neural Networks

In each of these parts you will get:

Intuition Lectures

Code Templates

Additional Resource

You can find all the code templates and additional resource on the following link:

Inside, you can get the Folder Structure of the course in Section 1, which is the whole course folder containing our three modules in empty sub-folders. Then you can populate them with either your own codes or the code templates, as you progress in the course.

We wish you a great AI journey!

Cheers,

Kirill & Hadelin
